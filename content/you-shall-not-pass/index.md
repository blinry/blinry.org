[Bine](https://bleeptrack.de) and I made this little game for the infamous [The Boston Stupid Shit No One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon](https://bostonstupidhackathon.com) in a single day.

It's a game about finding the perfect password that fulfills all criteria. :P It has three levels, and takes a few minutes to play. [Play it in your browser](https://youshallnotpass.glitch.me)!

We developed the game using Glitch, which worked amazingly well! You can look at the source code (or remix the project) [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/youshallnotpass).
