One my oldest digital works I still have. A stop motion video, made around 2001, filmed with the Lego Camera that came with the *Lego Mindstorms Vision Command* kit!

The content was probably inspired by the [*Plonsters*](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=plonsters). The video file is named *Mork.avi*, so I assume that was supposed to be the character's name!
