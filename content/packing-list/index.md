I'm keeping two packing lists, one for short-term and one for long-term traveling. Both are well-tested and time-proven, and have grown over many years. The first list tries to be complete, the second one tries to be minimalist.

I'm very glad to have them. It gives me a lot of confidence, being able to leave my apartment, knowing that I haven't forgotten anything important.

## Short-term packing list
