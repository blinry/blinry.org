*Hackerspaces: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the rocket Fairy Dust. Its one-year mission: to explore strange new technology, to seek out new life forms and new convention centers, to boldly go where no congress has gone before.*

The visual style of this animation is a reference to [Nyan Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyan_Cat), but the subject is one of the Chaos Computer Club's logos, the rocket *Fairy Dust*.

**In case you'd like to create your own Nyan Cat-style animation, you can use [my Aseprite file](fairy-dust.ase) as a basis.**

I posted this animation on twitter, and when I suggested that someone could create a soundtrack for the animation, an amazing piece of Internet collaboration happened: My friend Winnie extracted samples from Peter Marquardt's video [Electromagnetic Sounds of a Chaos Communication Congress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtFYSkJQMyw) and put together a music loop. He called the result *Fairy Dub*:

He also made a improved version 2.0, *Fairy Dubst*:

## Sticker

In late 2017, I made a sticker version, with slightly modified colors and a different aspect ratio. It is designed to be printed at size 3.5 x 10.5 cm, and already includes 1 mm bleed on all sides.
