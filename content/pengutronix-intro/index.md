The company [Pengutronix](https://www.pengutronix.de) does embedded Linux consulting & support, and which employs a number of my friends! They've been a lovely client of mine, and comissioned a number of logo designs over the years -- and in 2020, they asked me to create a **video intro for their talk recordings**!

## Version 0.1.0

Pengutronix' logo is a cute penguin, so that it seemed like an obvious choice to put it front and center! I put together a small 3D scene, and rendered it with Blender:

## Version 0.2.0

In the next version, I added snow and an audio jingle, incorporating dial-up modem sounds. :D

## Version 0.2.1

... which turned out way too Christmas-y, so I removed the snow again, and changed the instrumentation.

## Version 0.3.0

Here, I swapped out the jingle to something more soothing, changed the camera movement to go through two phases, and added a fish friend! üêü

## Version 1.0.0

A bit of polishing, and a few hours of render time later, this was the final intro video!

I really enjoyed the whole process, and being able to create this using open-source software is a great feeling. If anyone else wants an intro video like this, I'm open for commissions! :)
