Inspired by Bine's [Schnipsel](https://bleeptrack.de/schnipsel/2017/) project, I started making little ink drawings about every day of October!

Here's a collage of all the drawings! For me, it holds a lot of emotional value, because so many things happened that month! I fell in love, saw a bunch of great movies, and drove a car after a long time!

And here's a Twitter thread with the individual drawings:
