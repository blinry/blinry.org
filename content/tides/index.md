For the demoparty [Revision 2022](https://2022.revision-party.net), [Winnie](https://winniehell.de) and I made a music video that uses only HTML sliders! :D It won first place in the "Wild" competition!

There's a recording on YouTube:

## Online version

You can play the demo [here](play/) (works in Chrome, click to start the music).

## Make your own animations

I remade the framework as an interactive, minimalist creative coding tool! You can try it at <https://sliderland.blinry.org>!
