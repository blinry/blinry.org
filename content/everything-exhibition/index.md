## 🐞 Report bugs!

If something doesn't work or looks broken, please let us know! You can describe the issue you're having [in our issue tracker](https://github.com/blinry/everything-exhibition/issues).

## ✏ Write a content plugin!

We'd like to make it easy to add more content sources, besides MediaWikis! We think that HTML will be an even better "intermediate format", compared to Markdown.

But we're not quite there yet! Feel free to follow us to get notified as soon as we build an easy way to add content plugins:
