Hey FOSDEM people! :) We're [bleeptrack](https://twitter.com/bleeptrack) and [blinry](https://twitter.com/blinry), and you're probably here because of our lightning talk [Building a Git learning game](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/git_learning_game/). Here's a ton of links for ya! :D

## Play the game!

You can download binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows from [our itch.io page](https://blinry.itch.io/oh-my-git)!

After you've tried the current builds, you can help us improve the game by [filling out this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehHVcYfELT59h6plcn2ilbuqBcmDX3TH0qzB4jCgFIFOy_qg/viewform)!

If something doesn't work or looks broken, please let us know! You can describe the issue you're having [in our issue tracker](https://github.com/git-learning-game/oh-my-git/issues).

## Build your own levels!

You can find all the information on that in the project's [README](https://github.com/git-learning-game/oh-my-git). :)

## Support development!

Our current funding will run out at the end of February. If you wanna help us put more time into development, you can support us on Patreon! [Here](https://patreon.com/bleeptrack) and [here](https://patreon.com/blinry)!

## Get in touch!

Want to use this game in your teaching? Or at your workplace? Something resonated with you? We want to hear from you! :) Drop us an email: <span><span title="ihate@spam.com</span>">b</span>b</span>&#64;morr<i title="</i>mailto:">.</i>cc
