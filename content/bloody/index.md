This is our contribution Ludum Dare 38. This time, I was part of a four-person team including Pecca, Winnie, Moritz, and me.

Only an event like Ludum Dare gets me into a flow-like state which allows me to work on something without interruptions for 16 hours straight...

You can download the game [from the Ludum Dare website](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/a-bloody-small-world)!
