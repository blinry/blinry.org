This is our contribution Ludum Dare 38. This time, I was part of a four-person team together with Pecca, Winnie, and Moritz. We built a little, hectic racing game!

Only an event like Ludum Dare gets me into a flow-like state which allows me to work on something without interruptions for 16 hours straight...

You can download the game [from the Ludum Dare website](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/a-bloody-small-world)!

The Button Masher Bros did a hillarious playthrough, you should definitely watch it:

Also, Jupi covered it in her ongoing mission to play ALL THE indie games:

## Results

The ratings were generally rather good. But especially the "Fun" category could have been better... we learned our lesson.

Reviewers praised the cute characters, the soundtrack, and the narration.
