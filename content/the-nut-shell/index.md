In my bachelor thesis, I designed and implemented a framework for creating interactive command line tutorials, called *The Nut Shell*. Here you can find the final thesis and the presentation:

I posted the [LaTeX source code of the thesis](https://github.com/blinry/bachelor-thesis) online -- you are welcome to steal stuff from it!

While writing the thesis, I also [blogged about my experiences](/tag/bachelor/) (in German).

The resulting software framework can easily be adapted and reused to various command line environments, you can [read more about it here](/nutsh/).
