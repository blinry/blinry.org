At the 36th *Chaos Communication Congress*, [Bine](https://www.bleeptrack.de) and I did a third "Operation Mindfuck" talk about art, computers and curiosities! You can find the previous editions [here](/operation-mindfuck/) and [here](/operation-mindfuck-2/).

In this edition, we talked about strange chess variants, artsy Twitter bots, ray marching, daily drawings, mathematical paradoxes, leaf venation simulation, illegal prime numbers, and fun in latent space! Enjoy!

## Recordings

We gave the talk in German, but some kind friends did an awesome job live translating it into English! \o/ In the media.ccc.de player, you can switch languages using the cog icon:

Alternatively, the recordings are also on YouTube in German:
