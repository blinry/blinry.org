When I want to learn something new, an approach that works really well for me is to take on small, real-world projects, and learn everything I need while realizing that project.

In this case, I wanted to practice making music, so I asked around whether someone needed intro music for a podcast or something like that:

And to my delight, I got several nice requests! For example, [Ihro](https://twitter.com/LiMingRichter) and [Maya](https://twitter.com/MayaMitKind) just started producing [a German podcast about BDSM and polyamory](https://podcast.vielgeliebt.net). The name they picked ("Ihro Mayastät") is a play on words on a phrase used to address people of high royal position.

## Intro music

The intro music reflect this by using a baroque instrumentation, and announces the podcasters with fanfares and a orchestral buildup. I also like how the lead instruments – a trumpet and a cello playing pizzicato – seem to have a conversation, much like Ihro and Maya in the podcast! :)

Emotionally, I wanted to evoke a strong, proud, and optimistic mood.

## Outro music

There's also an outro version, which is softer, has a reduced instrumentation, and is less dramatic and epic. It also flows downwards, musically, to give listeners some nice closure at the end of the episode.

I used the open-source DAW [Ardour](https://www.ardour.org) to produce these, as well as the Creative Commons-licensed orchestral sample library [Virtual Playing Orchestra](http://virtualplaying.com).
