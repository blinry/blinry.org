Some kind people have started to ask me how they can leave me a tip in return. There are four ways of doing so:

- Patreon: [**patreon.com/blinry**](https://patreon.com/blinry)
- PayPal: [**paypal.me/sebastianmorr**](https://paypal.me/sebastianmorr)
- Bitcoin: **19zJgv4Nw2sVuH7ChPqckruzBpXMMqccNk**
- If these options don't appeal to you, you can also [ask](/about/) for my bank account number (IBAN).
