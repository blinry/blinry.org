The *SpaceAPI* provides information about hackerspaces, like addresses, contact information, or door opening status. One team member maintaining this project approached me and asked if I could design a logo for them. Well, sure! :)

## Regular version

This is the normal version, which can be used in website headers, on stickers, and other merchandise:

There's also a [clean SVG](spaceapi.svg) of this, which can be scaled up for large print sizes.

## Avatar version

This is a reduced version, which looks pretty in a square and a circle, and can be used as all kinds of avatars.

This also has a [clean SVG](spaceapi-avatar.svg).

## Favicon

And finally, there's a multi-resolution [favicon](favicon.ico).
