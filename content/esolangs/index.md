This was a fun overview paper written in my university seminar "Programming languages through the ages". I was very lucky to receive the awesome topic *Esoteric Programming Languages*! :-) In the paper and the accompanying talk, I give an overview of the languages Brainfuck, INTERCAL, Befunge, Malbolge, and Shakespeare.

You can also have a look at the [LaTeX source of the paper](http://github.com/blinry/esolangs).

In 2017, I gave an extended version of the talk at the [17. Gulaschprogrammiernacht](https://entropia.de/GPN17) (in German):
