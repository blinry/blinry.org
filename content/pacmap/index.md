PacMap is a little Android game that combines elements of Geocaching with those of crossword puzzles.

It was written in the beginning of 2012 with Sandra Hesse and Felix Geilert. Itâ€™s our contribution to the [informatiCup 2012](http://www.gi.de/wir-ueber-uns/wettbewerbe/informaticup/informaticup-2012.html) competition, where we reached the fourth place.

You can read the (german) documentation and take a look at our talk here:

You can also [download and play the app](pacmap.apk), of course!
