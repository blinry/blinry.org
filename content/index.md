<p>Hey there! My name is Sebastian Morr, Iâ€™m studying computer science at TU Braunschweig, Germany. On this site I publish things I create and share stuff I like.</p>

<p>Here's how to <a href="/about/">contact</a> me. And now, let's look at some things you can find here:</p>
</div>

# Newest things

<%= box(things[0..2]) %>

# My favorite things

<%= box((favs-things[0..2])[0..5]) %>

For more things, have a look at the categories:<br/>
<%= categories.map{|name, things| link_to(@items["/#{name.downcase}/"]) }.join(", ") %>.

You can also find a list of all things in the <%= link_to(@items["/archive/"]) %>.
