This is the second full song I ever created!

I had been flirting with the open source music creation software [LMMS](http://lmms.io) for many years, and always found it quite archaic and ugly. But a few weeks ago, I was annoyed how that prevented me from actually *making music*, so I decided to try to become friends with it. And while there are some annoying things missing for a really smooth workflow, I was actually pretty happy with the software.

I had the lead melody for this track in a drafts folder for several years, and expanded it to a full song. Thanks a ton to [lastfuture](https://broken.graphics/@alinanorakari), who gave me incredibly helpful advice, that made the song a lot better!

You can listen to it on SoundCloud or download it as [MP3](a-flicker-of-hope.mp3) or [FLAC](a-flicker-of-hope.flac). The LMMS project file is available [here](a-flicker-of-hope.mmpz), you'll need the [FluidSynth](http://www.fluidsynth.org) soundfont for the distorted guitar.
