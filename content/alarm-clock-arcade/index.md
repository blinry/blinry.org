For the Ludum Dare 51 game jam, [Kiki](https://flauschzelle.de) and me made another game!

It's an arcade game taking place inside an alarm clock! Inside the first digit of the seconds display, to be precise!

**Quick, start the alarm to wake up your human! But make sure not to be in a segment when it turns off!**

[Play it at the Ludum Dare website!](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/alarm-clock-arcade)

This was really fun to make -- the game even has its own intro animation, and features lots of fun sounds!
