At the [MRMCD 2023](https://2023.mrmcd.net), I gave a talk about my personal wiki, which I've been using for 12 years now! My wiki consists only of a folder with text files inside, and a simple Vim plugin, but it has since become a central part of my life and ultimately the *secret to my productivity*!

In the talk, I explain how my wiki works, what I use it for, and encourage you to build one too! Here's the (German) recording:
