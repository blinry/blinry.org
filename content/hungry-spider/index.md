Ever since I'd seen [RujiK's tweet](https://twitter.com/therujik/status/969581641680195585) about this, I wanted to try implementing inverse kinematics myself!

So for the *Berlin Mini Jam* in March 2020, I made a tiny prototype about a human-eating giant spider in Godot! :)

You can [play it in your browser](play/)! Move your mouse, and click-and-hold to jump/eat people! :>

Made with Godot. You can find the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/blinry/hungry-spider).
