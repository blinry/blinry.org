This is a song of beginnings. Most importantly, it's the first full real song I've ever created. It's also the first chiptune I made, and the first track I produced using [SunVox](http://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/)! I surely learned a lot while making it!

But it sounds rather dark, so I gave it a depressing name! :P

You can listen to it on SoundCloud or download it as [MP3](no-way-out.mp3) or [FLAC](no-way-out.flac). The SunVox project file is available [here](no-way-out.sunvox).
