[@nordlichtbot](https://twitter.com/nordlichtbot) is a Twitter bot which picks a random YouTube video every few hours, runs the [nordlicht](/nordlicht/) tool on it and tweets the result. It's currently used as an experimentation platform for new features, as a lazy CI framework and as a gallery of computer generated art.
