My second participation in a game jam, Ludum Dare 36. This time, I was part of a two-person team, which was crazily fun! The theme was "Ancient Technology", and we made a sailing game, which semi-realistic wind mechanics! You sail around, rescue people, and discover some secrets! If you ever wanted to learn how to sail against the wind, we invite you to give it a go!

We used the (awesome) 2D game engine [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), which uses the Lua programming language. You can download the game [from the Ludum Dare website](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=64665)!
