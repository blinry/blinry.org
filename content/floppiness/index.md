A chiptunes track made in [Ardour](https://ardour.org) in a week! I'm... not too fond of Ardour, to be honest. It had weird behaviour, crashed a couple of times, and forgot instrument setting after re-opening a project. Anyway, I made a song! :)

The only instrument I used is the [Helm synthesizer](https://tytel.org/helm/).

Thanks to Piko, Moritz and myri for providing feedback, helping make this track better!
