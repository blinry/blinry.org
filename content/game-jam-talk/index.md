At the [Chaos Communication Camp 2019](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2019/wiki/Main_Page), I gave a talk about "the why and how of game jams"! This is an extended version of my earlier talk [Dare to Ludum Dare](/dare-to-ludum-dare/), offering a more general view on game jams.

Here's the recording - you can switch between English audio and a German live translation via the cog icon. If you prefer, there are also [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnOuS2posj4) and [German](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE3vgMIzaRg) versions on YouTube. You can open the slides [here](slides/).
