# Comments

"This is an aesthetic bomb." –Shess

"Brilliant game. Love the seemly simple mechanics that can actually generate so many interesting puzzles." –jackyjjc

"Wow, this game blew my mind, supernice, this is incredible 5/5" –oskarOlausson

"Thanks to its great maze-like level design and the simple but ingenious concept idea, this game is one of the best puzzle games of Ludum Dare 42 in my opinion." -Sebastian Standke
